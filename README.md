If you have extra A4 paper, you can create personalized lined paper by printing your own text onto it. You get to decide how much blank space you want to leave on the paper, anywhere from no space at all to a full page of space. The text that you choose to print on the paper serves as a guide for your note-taking, helping you organize your thoughts based on what you decide to print on the paper. Essentially, you get to create custom paper that fits your specific note-taking needs.
